# BackgroundFX

Animated effects over the desktop wallpaper — drawn by a GPU shader on a
full-screen background surface, so every window stays on top of them. Toggled
from the wand icon in the Omarchy bar.

## Install

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/davidmessenger123/omarchy-rain.git --enable
```

The bar asks where to place the wand; `omarchy bar move davidjm.rain -s right`
moves it afterwards if you change your mind.

## Remove

```sh
omarchy plugin remove davidjm.rain
```

Settings changes are written atomically to the widget entry in
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`; removing the plugin leaves the wallpaper and
other shell settings untouched.

- Click the wand to toggle the effect on/off.
- The icon turns accent-colored while the effect is active.
- When off, the effect surface is unmapped: nothing composites and nothing runs.
- A framerate-tunable tick (15–60 fps, default 60) drives a shader `time`
  uniform; a single fragment shader paints every effect, rendered at a
  resolution scale you can set from 0.5x to 2x native.

## Effects

| Key | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Rain` | Falling streaks in three depth layers over a wet-window dim, with optional lightning bolts |
| `Snow` | Drifting, tumbling flakes in three depth layers with wind sway |
| `Ripples` | Rain landing on water: expanding puddle rings |
| `Fog` | Soft banks of mist rolling slowly across the screen, thickest near the ground |
| `Dust` | Barely-moving motes drifting through a faint diagonal light shaft |
| `Fireflies` | Warm-green points of light wandering and blinking at dusk |
| `Leaves` | Autumn leaves tumbling down through warm golden light, or Cherry Blossom via the STYLE sub-menu |
| `Aurora` | Undulating northern-lights curtains over a starry night sky (optional audio-reactive) |
| `Starfield` | Gliding through deep space: stars stream outward from the centre and rush past |
| `Nebula` | Glowing clouds of interstellar gas in magenta, blue and teal, drifting over faint stars |
| `Meteors` | Shooting stars streaking across a dark sky from a shared radiant |
| `Embers` | Warm fire sparks drifting up from below, flickering as they rise |
| `Bubbles` | Clear round bubbles rising from the bottom edge, each with a bright rim |
| `Confetti` | Small bright paper rectangles fluttering down in a light crosswind |
| `Caustics` | Shimmering underwater light-web, like light on a shallow pool bed |
| `Light Shafts` | Sunbeams streaming from a chosen corner (CORNER sub-menu, STRAIGHTNESS slider) |

## Settings

**Right-click the wand for a settings menu**: an effect switch, a **STYLE**
sub-menu for Falling Leaves (autumn or cherry blossom), a **CORNER** sub-menu
and **STRAIGHTNESS** slider for Light Shafts, a **COLOR** menu that recolors any
effect, an **intensity slider**
(relabeled per effect, 1 = light to 3 = heavy), a **speed slider**, a
**framerate slider** (15–60 fps), a **resolution slider**
(0.5x–2x native, in 0.5x steps), a **lightning** toggle for the rain
effect, and an **audio reactive** toggle for the aurora (it swells and
shimmers with what you play). Sliders preview live while you drag and commit
on release — values are validated, coalesced into a bounded pending queue, and
written as flat keys on the widget's own entry in `shell.json` through the
shared `.shell.json.lock` and recoverable transaction journal used by Bar
Editor and Boost. Each helper has a five-second watchdog so a stuck
write cannot block newer settings. Duplicate widgets receive a stable private
instance ID, and ambiguous instance selection fails closed. The shell
hot-applies each successful write to the running widget, so no editor or restart
is needed. Framerate and resolution apply to **every** effect, not per effect.
The offscreen shader is capped at 8,294,400 pixels so a very large display
cannot turn the selected scale into an unbounded render.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `effect` | string | `"Rain"` | `Rain`, `Snow`, `Ripples`, `Fog`, `Dust`, `Fireflies`, `Leaves`, `Aurora`, `Starfield`, `Nebula`, `Meteors`, `Embers`, `Bubbles`, `Confetti`, `Caustics`, `Light Shafts` |
| `variant` | string | `"autumn"` | Falling Leaves: `autumn` or `cherry` |
| `corner` | string | `"tl"` | Light Shafts: `tl`, `tr`, `bl`, `br` source corner |
| `straightness` | number | `1` | Light Shafts: 0 (wavy) to 2 (ruler-straight), in 0.1 steps |
| `color` | string | `"default"` | Recolor every effect: `default` (each effect's own palette), `accent` (theme accent), `white`, `ice`, `aqua`, `mint`, `lime`, `gold`, `amber`, `red`, `rose`, `violet`, or any `"#rrggbb"` |
| `running` | boolean | `false` | Whether the effect surface is active |
| `density` | number | `2` | 1 (light) to 3 (heavy), in 0.1 steps; per-effect meaning |
| `speed` | number | `1` | 0.5 (lazy) to 3 (fast) effect motion |
| `fps` | number | `60` | Animation framerate, 15–60 (lower = less GPU, choppier) |
| `quality` | number | `1` | Render scale vs native: 0.5 / 1 / 1.5 / 2 (2x = supersampled), subject to the render-pixel cap |
| `lightning` | boolean | `true` | Random real bolts for `Rain` |
| `audio` | boolean | `false` | `Aurora` reacts to system audio |

The menu is also the fastest way to read the current baked-in values; the same
fields can be hand-edited too (flat keys, like the stock widgets):

```json
{
  "id": "davidjm.rain",
  "effect": "Rain",
  "density": 2.4,
  "speed": 1.2,
  "fps": 60,
  "quality": 1,
  "lightning": true,
  "audio": true
}
```

## How it works

- The effect `PanelWindow` maps with `WlrLayer.Background`, the same layer the
  wallpaper uses (`namespace: "omarchy-background"`). Because it is created
  after the wallpaper, it composites above it but below all windows and the bar.
- `screen:` is bound to the bar window's monitor, so multi-bar setups get one
  effect surface per monitor with no duplication.
- The shader source lives in `rain.frag` / `rain.vert`, precompiled to
  `.qsb` (Qt 6 ShaderEffect requires the precompiled form) and driven by
  uniforms: `time`, `uRes`, `uIntensity` (raw 1–3), `uSpeed`, `uEffect`
  (the implemented effect switch), plus the lightning, leaf-style, corner,
  straightness, and audio uniforms used by their respective effects, and
  `uTint` (the `color` setting) which `main()` applies to whichever effect
  is showing.
- The effect is painted into an offscreen canvas whose size is `quality` × the
  monitor's resolution, captured with `ShaderEffectSource` (`live`) and
  stretched over the full screen by a second, trivial sampling pass
  (`upscale.frag`). At 0.5x that is a quarter of the pixels per frame; at 2x
  the effect is supersampled and downscaled, subject to the fixed pixel cap.
  `time` still advances by real seconds per tick, so lowering `fps` slows the
  *frame rate*, not the motion.
- Lightning is a QML sidecar: a drifting random timer picks a strike, freezes
  its shape (seed + screen position + length), then a five-step SequentialAnimation
  flickers `uStrike` 1 → 0 → 1 → 0 like a real bolt; the shader renders the
  jagged polyline and a soft sky glow, and a slow Behavior fade closes the flash.

## Developing

Every effect is one branch of `scene()` in `rain.frag`; `main()` calls it and
then applies the colour tint. Qt only loads the compiled `rain.frag.qsb`, so
rebuild it after every shader edit. **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the full
guide** (written so a coding agent can follow it step by step). The short
version:

```sh
python3 tools/new_effect.py Lanterns --description "Paper lanterns rising" --after Embers
#   ...write the effect in the TODO(Lanterns) branch of rain.frag...
tools/build_shader.sh                       # compile rain.frag -> rain.frag.qsb
python3 tools/render_effect.py --effect Lanterns --time 2 6 12   # look at it
python3 tools/render_effect.py --all --compare old/rain.frag.qsb  # nothing else changed
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

- `tools/new_effect.py` registers a new effect in `Rain.qml`,
  `write_settings.py`, `manifest.json`, this README, and adds a working
  starter branch to `rain.frag`.
- `tools/build_shader.sh` finds Qt's `qsb` (`qt6-shadertools`, or a PySide6
  install) and runs `qsb --glsl 440`, which reproduces the committed `.qsb`
  byte for byte; `--check` reports a stale build.
- `tools/render_effect.py` draws effects to PNG with the real shader, with no
  Omarchy needed (it uses `xvfb-run` when there is no display).
- The tests fail if the effect lists in those files disagree or a starter
  branch was never replaced.

## Notes

- Effects render behind windows, so fullscreen windows cover them entirely.
- The overlay is a plain transparent layer surface; it does not intercept
  input, so the desktop stays fully interactive.
